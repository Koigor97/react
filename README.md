# React.js

React is a JavaScript framework/library that boost developmen productivity x2. It all about component (resuable) that can be used in different projects. Now this repository is all about my React development journey. Wish me luck üí™üèΩüíØ.

> [!Info]  
> I am learning react with Jonas Schmedtmann React course on Udemy. All projects are designed by him.

### So what is React‚ùì:

React is **component based**, meaning is all about putting a collection components (like a pricing card, navigation, carousel etc.) together to form a complex user interface. It's putting a puzzle together to reveal the whole picture. Components are reusable. React is **declarative.** This means we tell React what to do. This is possible using JXS. JSX combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Since react update the UI keeping in sync with the data, react is **State-driven** (data). React is actually just a library not a framework. React as a "framework" is very popular amongst developers. Big company use react in their web applications, followed by smaller or start up company. It has a vibrant and densed community. Plus, it is created by Facebook/Meta to provide more structure to it's code and allow it to scale much better.

#### What I learned today - 05/Sep/2023:

#### Pure React:

Pure React is basically writing React inside a regular HTML file, without a modern tooling or any build step. For that to happen, one must link/include the React library as a script.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.>development.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```

The code below is an example of a so called Pure React:

```js
    <script>
      function App() {
        // const time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
        const [time, setTime] = React.useState(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
        React.useEffect(function () {
          setInterval(() => {
            setTime(new Date().toLocaleTimeString());
          }, 1000);
        }, []);
        return React.createElement(
          "header",    // the element type
          null,    //An object containing properties to be applied on the element - in this case there is no property so 'null' is passed.
          `Hello World!... The time is: ${time}`    // the content of the element. Also reffered to as children
        );
      }
      const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      root.render(React.createElement(App));
    </script>
```

The above codebase created a `header` component with the `React.createElement` that has a string _hello world..._ and **time** state(variable) that is updates every second using `React.useEffect` and the JS setInterval(). This all then render by the DOM.

To set up a React project, you have 2 options. One is `Create-React-App` which is ideal for smaller projects, but is slow and outdated. The other is `Vite`, geared towards complex production react applications. It is extremely fast.

#### `Components`:

- As earlier mentioned, React applications are component based.
- These components are the building blocks of the UI.
- Components comprises of 'data', 'logic' and 'appearance'.
- And ofcourse components are reused, can be nested (parent and child component), and data can be passed between them.

#### `JSX`:

- JSX is a JavaScript extension that allows us to embed JavaScript, CSS and React components into HTML.
- JSX is similar to HTML but it's not HTML.
- Every components must return a block of JSX.
- But we can use React without JSX.
- JSX is declarative (meaning it describes what the component should look like) rather than imperative (how to do things.)

**Few rules of JSX**:  
| General Rules of JSX | Difference between JSX and HTML |
| :------------------: | :-----------------------------: |
| Statement are not allowed. Like 'if/else', 'for' or 'switch' | JSX uses className instead of HTML class |
JSX produces JavaScript expression which allows us to use JS expressions, like create arrays or objects, ternary operator, reference variables etc. by using using '{ }' | Event handlers and other properties should be **camelCased** |
| If you need more than one root element you can use `<React.Fragment> or <> for short`, otherwise every piece of JSX can only have **one root element.** | CSS property names are also **camelCased**. We can write in CSS in JSX like this: `{{<style>}}` |

#### `Props`:

- Props are just variables used to pass data from the parent components to the child components.
- However, they are **immutable**. **State** on the other hand is mutable. These are variables declared in the child component.
- Props can be anything. An array, objects, functions, values or even other components.
- And with props, parent components control the look and feel, and function of the child components.

#### What I learned today - 08/Sep/2023:

`State` is the most important concept in React. So what is state?  
State, is the component's memory üß†. A state persist or mutuates based on it use case throughout an application's lifecycle. When a state is mutated/updated, it triggers React to update the UI view of the component. When one masters 'State', he/she unlock the power of React development.  
We declare state using the '**useState**' by: `const [step, setStep] = useState(1);`.
And we update that state like this: `setStep(step + 1);`

|                               Practical Guideline About State                                |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|      If a data will change during the lifecycle of the application, use State variables      |
|              Create a state for something that is dynamic. Like a modal window.              |
| If a component or a data changes it looks whenever an event happens, use State to update it. |
|                Any data that don't trigger a re-render, use regular variables                |
